# Algorithms Directory

This folder contains algorithm implementations used in the `cpgene` application.

## Developer instructions

### Adding a new Algorithm

1. Save the algorithm to a separate file here
2. Go to `app.schemas` and add the algorithm to `Algorithm`
3. Go to `app.services.get_algorithms` and add the algorithm there too

## Structure

- Each file represents a distinct algorithm.
- Code is organized for clarity and maintainability.

## Contribution

1. Add new algorithms in separate files or folders.
2. Document each algorithm with usage instructions and examples.
3. Ensure code is tested and follows project conventions.
